It's been less than 500 miles since last oil change and today had to put 1/2 quart of oil. Had all recalls done. Told the dealership it was using oil, they said it was a faulty gasket and oil drain plug was lose. Changed everything including oil,gasket and tightened the oil drain plug. But today less than 500 miles later had to add half quart of oil. I am the original owner and I know Kia says a quart per 1000 miles is acceptable. I have owned older cars with over 100,000 miles never used oil in between changes, I have owned new cars never had to top off between oil changes. I am afraid my engine should be recalled now, I don't trust my soul anymore. There's absolutely no reason for this car with 50,000 miles should be using oil. If it breaks down I am hearing that Kia probably won't repair or put new motor in as I have read and heard everyone saying. Even doing a compression test they won't pay for it unless it's rod bearing, no rental car during any time. I have lots of doctors appointments that are over 2 hours away and I am scared of being broken down ( disabled 61 years old female). I am scared that this car is going to cause me harm . I don't know if the dealership even looked into the rings when they did the recall. Also I have nobody to borrow car from so if Kia was to do the warranty I would need a loaner car, rental car for the duration of the work.",ENGINE,35289

On these vehicles the cruise control is turned on automatically when the vehicle is started. There is a white indicator icon illuminated on the drivers display to inform the driver. However the owners manual says you have to turn the system on by pressing the Driving Assist Mode Switch inferring the cruise control should not automatically be turned on. Pressing this switch only allows you to switch modes from Dynamic Radar Cruise Control to Standard Cruise Control. My dealer advised that this is normal for my vehicle and the cruise control system is working as designed. I agree all functions of the system work, except there is no way to turn off the cruise control. Nothing about turning off the cruise control is stated in the owners manual either. Every Toyota from 2022 and older, and some 2023's, have an on off switch. The issue is once the cruise control is set (now a green illuminated icon), the set speed is always on the display until the vehicle is turned off. Even if you ""Cancel"" the set speed, the speed is always there (white icon) so you can ""Resume"" (green icon). If you no longer have use for the cruise control there is no way to just turn it off. Example: You have just exited the interstate highway onto a city street that is 25 MPH. The cancelled set speed is still displaying 70 MPH and while driving you accidentally hit the resume button on the steering wheel and the vehicle accelerates and hits the car in front of you. I know there are anti-collision features that might help, but a startled/panic driver can react in a very negative way and still cause an accident or injury. Even Toyota says not to depend on these safety features alone that it is the drivers responsibility to operate the vehicle safely.  I did notify Toyota Brand Engagement Center, who filed a case, but said I would not be informed unless a recall.",VEHICLE SPEED CONTROL,144488
